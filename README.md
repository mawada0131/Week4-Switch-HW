# Week4-Switch-HW
The library exercise and the Permutations exercise.


Library Exercise Solution:

Option A: Using Three Dictionaries

Description:
- One dictionary stores books by their IDs.
- The second maps titles to book IDs.
- The third maps authors to lists of book IDs.

Pros:
- Efficient search by title or author (O(1) for dictionary lookups).
- Allows easy updates and removals without duplicating data.
- Scales well for large data sets due to the efficient hashing mechanism.

Cons:
- Increased complexity due to maintaining multiple dictionaries.
- Risk of inconsistency if changes arenâ€™t synchronized across dictionaries.

Option B: Using a List of Book Objects

Description:
A single list contains objects, where each object represents a book with all its attributes.

Pros:
- Simple and easy to implement.
- No risk of synchronization issues since data is centralized in one structure.
- Flexible for adding more attributes to books.

Cons:
- Searching requires iterating through the list (O(n) complexity), which can become slow for large libraries.
- Less efficient for operations targeting specific fields (e.g., search by author).
